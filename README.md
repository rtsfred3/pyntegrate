## What are C Extensions in Python?

C Extensions allow for native C/C++ code (with a small penalty) to be used within Python. The documentation can be found [here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/index.html), [here](https://docs.python.org/3/extending/extending.html), and [here](https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/index.html).



## Why use C Extensions?

The main benefit of using C Extensions would be the speed of C, with a slight penalty, when translating between C and Python.
